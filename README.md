🚀 DAY 5/50 - Java Mini Project Challenge
🔹 Project: Number Guessing Game 🎯
🔹 Description: Developed a fun interactive game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number. The program gives hints (higher/lower) until the user guesses correctly!

💻 Tech Used: Java (Random, Loops, Conditionals, Scanner)

✅ What I Learned:

Generating random numbers using Random class

Implementing loops for repeated attempts

Providing hints based on user input

Handling user input efficiently
