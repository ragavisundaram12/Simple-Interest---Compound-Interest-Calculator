ðŸš€ DAY 4/50 - Java Mini Project Challenge
ðŸ”¹ Project: Simple & Compound Interest Calculator
ðŸ”¹ Description: Created a Java program that calculates Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI) based on user input. The program takes the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period to compute accurate results.

ðŸ’» Tech Used: Java (Scanner, Math.pow, Conditionals)

âœ… What I Learned:

Using Scanner for user input

Applying mathematical formulas in Java

Using Math.pow() for exponentiation

Structuring a menu-driven program
